The script takes each of the 41 indices of vector A ([-10 : 0.5 : 10]) and
creates two new vectors, vector B which calculates the values of A to the power
of 3, and vector C which raises 2 to the power of each of the values of A.

It then plots the values of A on the x-axis, and the corresponding values of
B (A^3) and C (2^A) on the y axis as curves.

The values of A begin at -10 and then increment by 0.5 until reaching 10.
As such, the expected shape of the graph of B is a cubic parabola; it starts at -1000 (-10^3),
and ends at 1000 (10^3). The inflection point is at A = 0. At values higher than A = 0,
the curve of B should exponentially increase as the values of A linearly increase.
Likewise, at values of A < 0, the value of B will exponentially decrease as the
value of A linearly decreases, in the same shape as that of the values for A > 0.

The shape of the graph of C (2^(A(index)) should begin very close to zero, as two to the power
of a negative number will return a value > 0 and < 1. The value for C at A = 0 will be equal to 1.
This means that the shape of the curve from A=-10 to A = 0 will represent a fairly straight line
relative to the minimum and maximum values of y axis (-1000, 1050 respectively). From values of A > 0, 
the curve should exponentially increase from 1.41 to 1024.
