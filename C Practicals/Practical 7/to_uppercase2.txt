Test case one tests a normal use case where the user has followed the instructions, and the program responds as expected, capitalising the uncapitalised letters, leaving capitalised letters capitalised, and leaving the comma unchanged.
Test case two tests a name with the maximum number of characters (when the two commas are included), and it is output correctly, as expected.
Test case three tests the same person but with their full middle name, thereby exceeding the maximum number of characters. As such, it is expected that the input is truncated to twenty characters (including the commas), which it is.
Test case four tests a single name without any commas to ensure that the program can handle single inputs; it does.
Test case five tests a name with an apostrophe, which is not permitted by the code (or practical), and as such, an error is thrown that a special character other than a comma was used, and the program aborts as expected.
Test case six tests a name with a space, which is also not allowed by the program or practical, and as such, an error is thrown regarding the presence of a space, and the program aborts as expected.
Test case seven tests a numerical input, with a comma dividing the two sets of numberals. Numbers are not allowed (similarly to special characters other than commas, and spaces), and consequentially an error message is thrown and the program aborts, as expected.
Test case eight tests a boundary case, no input, and the program correctly recognises the 0th index of the nameArray as a '\n' new line character, and responds with an error message and aborts the program as expected.
Test case nine tests a boundary case, a very long input of 51 characters (the abbreviated name of a German-born American typesetter who holds the record for the longest name ever used) - as expected, only the first twenty characters are printed in uppercase.
