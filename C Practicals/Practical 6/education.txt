Test case one tests for the case of secondary level of education, which is returned correctly, in addition to the message that less than a year is left a until high-schoo diploma is achieved, as expected.
Test case two tests for the case of primary level education, and also tests whether the program can handle zero, which is also returned correctly, in addition to the message that eight years remain until high-school.
Test case three tests for an integer larger than a. Is humanly possible (due to inability to live that long), and 2. Larger than the variable type (int) can store. As a result, the integer assigned to yearsEd (-1) throws the error in the conditional statement: if (yearsEd < 0) {}, and the program is aborted.
Test case four tests four tests for a tertiary level of education, which is accurately displayed, in addition to the messsage about potentially having an honours or Master's degree, as expected. If 19 were tested, it would say they may have a PhD.
Test case five tests for character inputs, which similarly to test case three defaults to -1 for yearsEd, causing the error to be thrown and the program is aborted.
Test case six tests for a negative number input, and an error is thrown, as in test cases five and three, then the program aborts as expected.
