  Test case one tests a normal integer within the range (1-12), amd Apr is returned as expected.
  Test case two tests another normal integer, 7, and Jul is returned as expected.
  Test case three also tests a valid month number, 12, and Dec is returned as expected.
  Test case four tests a number outside of the range, but because a switch statement is used and the default is Dec, Dec is returned as expected.
  Test case five is similar to four, but tests the input abcd; as C is expecting an integer, it defaults to the defined value of the variable month(0), which thus returns Dec as the default.
  Test case six tests a negative number, which again returns Dec as the default.
  Test case seven tests a very large number (900000000000000000000), and Dec is returned as the default again. The switch statement is useful in this regard, as if the value assigned to the
  month variable is larger than the allocated memory for it (int), it will default to the default case (in this case Dec.)
