Test case one tests a simple integer input, and the result is as expected (although it is not rounded correctly, this is expected as we are using type int.)
Test case two tests the defensive programming, by inputting a character. The ERROR is accurately displayed, and the user is reprompted for a numerical input.
Test Case three tests for the crossover in the celsisus and fahrenheit scale, -40, and also tests a negative number. This works properly.
Test case four tests an approximation of the human body temperature, and is correctly converted (again, not rounded correctly as expected.)
Test case five ensures that zero can be handled by the script, which it can.
Test case six tests a large number - the type is int, so does have a limit as to how large a number can be handled. 99999 is accurately converted.
Test case seven tests an even larger number, which overrides the limit of int, and hence the memory allocated to the integer is overridden and a garbage value of 
-1 is assigned to celsius (when it was defined as 0).
