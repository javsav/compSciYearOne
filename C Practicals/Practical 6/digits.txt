Test case 1 tests for a normal three digit number and the script responds in the manner expected.
Test case 2 tests for a negative number and the script properly prints -4, -2, and 0.
Test case 3 tests for an invalid input (starting with 0), and the script throws an error and reprompts the user for input. EDIT: had to remove while loop because of autograder issue, so just aborts program now.
Test case 4 also tests for an invalid input, this time with one too many digits, and the script once again throws an error and reprompts the user for input. EDIT: had to remove while loop because of autograder issue, so just aborts program now.
