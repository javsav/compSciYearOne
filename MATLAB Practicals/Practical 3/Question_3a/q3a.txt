33              Not divisible by four, remainder = 1                                   33.00 is not divisible by four, 33.00 / 4 leaves a remainder of 1.00 
0               Reprompt user for numerical value other than 0, user enters 16                  16.00 is evenly divisible by four; 4 * 4 = 16. 
"four hundred'    Throw error due to use of string                                       Error using  == ; Comparison between string and double is not supported.

These test cases require little explanation as the program is simple.

Test case 1 involves the user entering 33 and receiving the answer that it is not divisible by four, and that 33/4 has a remainder of 1. This is correct.

Test case 2 involves the user entering the value 0, after which the while loop effectively prompts them to enter a numerical value other than 0, so they 
enter 16. They are told that 16 is evenly divisible by four; 4 * 4 = 16

Test case 3 involves the user entering the value "four hundred" which if entered as a float would be true (4 * 100 = 400), however due to the use of a string
and comparison with a double (mod(number,4)), an error is thrown: Error using  == ; Comparison between string and double is not supported.
